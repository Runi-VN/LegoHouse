# LegoHouse
2nd semester 2nd project  
This project was made directly after [Cupcake](https://github.com/Castau/CupCake) to ensure that we (students) had all learned the same required knowledge from the Cupcake project. This was primarily because we worked as 3-5-man groups, so some students might have missed out on some parts, i.e. how to use JDBC to connect to a database.

Due to this, the overall design and some parts are straight up ripped out of the Cupcake project.
